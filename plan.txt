Provide list of words for user to solve 
    array to store list of words
    check what letters have guessed
    letters that are wrong
    letters that are correct

    init three arrays
    function that takes input from user
        process input and make app smoother
        check for characters
    used letter array // append wrong letters
    used letter array // append right letter
    check word is equal to number of letters 
    if length of array is equal to 7 game over

# empty array for lettersGuessed
# empty array for 'mystery word' // set limit on number of letters in word
# array of lives (7 tries)



# randomly generate word // limit of 7 letters
# prompt user to input letter guess
        
# function to ask player to input letter --> 'guess'
# if/else to check guess is incorrect or not
        # if '' is True:
        # store letter in mysteryWord array
        # print "Correct Guess: Keep Going!"   
        # print mysteryWord array


        # put correct letter in all spaces that match
        # move letter to lettersGuessed array
    # if guess is incorrect, draw something // move letter to lettersGuessed array
        # if '' is False:
            # removeLife()
            # draw Spaceman (/7) 
            # store letter in lettersGuessed
            # print "Guess Incorrect: Keep Trying!"
            # print mysteryWord array

    # if player guesses wrong 7 times the game is over
    # if player completes word in under 7 tries, they win game
